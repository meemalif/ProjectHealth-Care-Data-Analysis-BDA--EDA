## Introduction

### Objective
Analyze healthcare data to enhance patient care, improve hospital management, and optimize resource allocation.

### Importance of Big Data in Healthcare
Big Data involves handling large volumes of varied data to uncover hidden patterns and improve decision-making. This includes patient demographics, medical conditions, treatments, and billing information.

## Data Description

### Overview
Detailed explanation of the data collected:
- **Patient Demographics**: Name, age, gender.
- **Clinical Data**: Blood type, medical conditions, medications.
- **Administrative Data**: Doctor, hospital details, room number, insurance provider.
- **Financial Data**: Billing amounts.
- **Admission and Discharge Records**: Dates and related details.

### Data Characteristics
1. **Volume**: Large amount of data per patient.
2. **Variety**: Various types of data (textual, numerical, categorical).
3. **Velocity**: Data collection speed (real-time or near real-time).
4. **Veracity**: Importance of data accuracy and authenticity.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
Processes involved in gathering the healthcare data.

### Data Pre-processing
Steps to clean and prepare data for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Demographic Insights**: Age distribution and healthcare demand among elderly patients.
- **Medical Conditions**: Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
- **Billing Information**: Analysis based on treatment complexity and insurance coverage.
- **Patient Outcomes and Length of Stay**.
- **Doctors Evaluation**.
